Yes, you may write an udev rule.

In /etc/udev/rules.d make a file 30-mydevice.rules (number has to be from 0 to 99 and decides only about the script running order; name doesn't really matter, it has just to be descriptive; .rules extension is required, though)

In this example I'm assuming your device is USB based and you know it's vendor and product id (can be checked using lsusb -v), and you're using mydevice group your user has to be in to use the device. This should be file contents in that case:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0123", SYSFS{idProduct}=="4567", ACTION=="add", GROUP="mydevice", MODE="0664"

MODE equal to 0664 allows device to be written to by it's owner (probably root) and the defined group.
